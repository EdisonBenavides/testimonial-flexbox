                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                <br />
                were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br />
                honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                been looking to make a <br />
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                experience here. I signed up for <br />
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course, I’ve <br />
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at
                a VR startup.”

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br>

            “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>
            never written a line of code. I needed <br>
            some structure from professionals <br>
            who can help me learn programming <br>
            step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
            enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
            who can only say wonderful things <br>
            about the program. The entire <br>
            curriculum and staff did not <br>
            disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
            and I never had to wait long for <br>
            assistance. The agile team project, in <br>
            particular, was outstanding. It took <br>
            my learning to the next level in a way <br>
            that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>
            fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>
            interviews as an example of my <br>
            developent experience. It certainly <br>
            helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
            developer after receiving multiple <br>
            offers. 100% recommend! ”
